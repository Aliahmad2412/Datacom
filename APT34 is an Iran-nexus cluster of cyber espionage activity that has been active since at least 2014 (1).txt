APT34 is an Iran-nexus cluster of cyber espionage activity that has been active since at least 2014.  FireEye identified a phishing campaign conducted by APT34, an Iranian-nexus threat actor.APT34 aligns with elements of activity reported as OilRig and Greenbug, by various security researchers.
The activities observed by Managed Defense, and described in this post, were primarily targeting the following industries:
* Energy and Utilities
* Government
* Oil and GasThe Managed Defense SOC analyzed the alert and identified a malicious file named System.doc (MD5: b338baa673ac007d7af54075ea69660b), located in C:\Users\\.templates. The file System.doc is a Windows Portable Executable (PE), despite having a "doc" file extension. FireEye identified this new malware family as TONEDEAF.
* Retracing the steps preceding exploit detection, FireEye identified that System.doc was dropped by a file named ERFT-Details.xls. Combining endpoint- and network-visibility, we were able to correlate that ERFT-Details.xls originated from the URL http://www.cam-research-ac[.]com/Documents/ERFT-Details.xls. Network evidence also showed the access of a LinkedIn message directly preceding the spreadsheet download.
FireEye examined the original file ERFT-Details.xls, which was observed with at least two unique MD5 file hashes:
* 96feed478c347d4b95a8224de26a1b2c
* caf418cbf6a9c4e93e79d4714d5d3b87
A snippet of the VBA code, provided in Figure 2, creates System.doc in the target directory from base64-encoded text upon opening.
